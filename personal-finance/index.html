<h2 id="sylvia-porters-new-money-book">Sylvia Porter’s New Money Book</h2>
<p>Sylvia Porter is not Iddding. Tfiis is about money, not so much iiow to make it but flow to fieep, save, and judiciously spend it. There is advice and information on every purchasing decision, and it is usually good advice. —Paul Hawken</p>

<h2 id="how-to-find-the-right-site">How To Find The Right Site</h2>
<p>Before you invest a penny in your dream house you must find the right property on which to build. Here’s how to
go about it:</p>

<p>• Find out from the town clerk’s office the zoning regulations in the neighborhood in which the property you</p>

<p>• like is situated.</p>

<p>• Ask for a survey of the lot. Exactly where are the boundaries? (Walk the lines yourself.)</p>

<p>• Plan to invest in a title search, no matter how little the lot costs.</p>

<p>• Find out from local lenders whether they will make home-building loans in your neighborhood. A good source of information is the Federal Housing Administration’s nearest branch office. The FHA considers the neighborhood as well as the individual house when it insures loans.</p>

<p>• Inspect the lot after a heavy rain; if possible, after several days of downpour. That will show how rapidly surface water leaves the site. If a plot is f i l l e d , the f i ll may settle and take the house along with i t.</p>

<p>• Be wary of land subdivisions still in the “blueprint stage.” These always are a gamble.</p>

<h2 id="what-fund-for-you">What Fund For You?</h2>
<p>Every investor certainly should investigate funds. Many of you will find the funds are suitable for achieving your investment goals.
To help you determine the kind of mutual fund that is best suited for you, here are broad guidelines.</p>

<p>Specifically, if you are:</p>

<p>‘Single, earning under $15,000, with a savings-oriented (conservative) temperament: you should own an income fund with a dual goal of providing some longer-term capital growth.
• Single, earning under $15,000, w i th a chance-taker’s (aggressive) temperament: yours should be a “total return” fund, concentrating on high-growth common stocks or a long-term growth fund.</p>

<p>• Married, with two or three dependents, earning $15,000 to $25,000, w i th a conservative temperament: the best for you would be a blue-chip, common stock fund, for long-term growth of both capital and income.</p>

<p>• Married, with two or three dependents, earning $25,000 and up, w i th a growth-oriented temperament: yours should be either a pu’ a “income” fund, a “moneymarket” fund, or a bond fund.</p>

<p>• Working couple, earning $25,000 and up, w i th growthoriented temperament: obviously, a growth fund is for you, so the investments can help you accumulate resources for future tuition needs, travel and other recreation, retirement, etc.</p>

<p>• Older person, income coming from Social Security and some savings, w i th a conservative temperament and a goal of preservation of capital and more current income:</p>

<p>ideally, the medium should be an income fund of the more conservative type which pays dividends and has some appreciation possibilities. Or a money-market fund which will preserve capital and offer a satisfactory yield.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-buy-mutual-funds">Why Should You Buy Mutual Funds?</h2>
<p>If I were to tell you that the investment advice given to the small investor in the United States is far inferior to that given to the big guy, and that the men and women who give that advice agree the above is true, wouldn’t you be deeply disturbed? Okay, I’m telling you that this is the opinion of an overwhelming percentage of the nation’s security analysts. According to a recent survey:</p>

<p>• A shocking seven out of ten security analysts have “reservations about the advice available to the small investor as compared with that given the large one.”</p>

<p>• Only one in three believes that “the quality of investment advice now available adequately serves all types of investors.”</p>

<p>• Nearly half favor “some form of blanket registration of security analysts” (in short, greater control).</p>

<p>M ORE IMPORTANT MISTAKES A RE made about personal finance ~ about money in general — than maybe any other easily correctable area of human folly. It’s one of those things that majoring in English, or being on the Left, or seeing yourself as a noble artist, scientist, or spiritual person can prevent you from ever getting right — to the vast detriment of your writing, politics, art, science, or spiritual practice. Money ain ‘t bad. Money is good. Restart from there and it’s no big problem, just a somewhat interesting chore, like personal health. —SB</p>

<h2 id="money-honey-1980-by-george-von-hikheimer">Money, Honey, 1980 by George von Hikheimer</h2>
<p>In the month or so since Art Kleiner phoned me to ask for a 10 year anniversary comment on my “Money, Honey”article in The Last Whole Earth Catalog, I’ve had fun diddling around modeling all the strategies I might have used following my own advice in 1970.</p>

<p>$30,000 invested at maximum leverage in bags of U.S. silver dimes could have been cashed in this year for $2,000,000 — that’s figuring worst case interest on the leverage and having just left it all alone to fatten the bankers whilst it fattened you.</p>

<p>Our commune invested exactly that amount in 1969, but bailed out in three years to buy farmland. The farmland has not appreciated at all, at all, but we are not complaining. We’ve essentially had no money hassles. We are grateful that JFK and his co-thieves had such a delirious money policy. The Feds recently sold silver “dollars “ for 45 to 65 paper “dollars.” My. A rose is a rose but a dollar isn ‘t a dollar.</p>

<p>The second option I suggested 11 years ago made us a mere 1000% profit. Two bars of silver we bought at $1.55per ounce in 1969 were sold in 1979 for $16an ounce, less 5% smelter’s fee. With a little bit of luck we could have sold them at $50 an ounce in February, but that’s crap shooting. In silver, just follow your long term plan, using YEARS or catastrophes as your selling semaphore.</p>

<p>I couldn ‘t advise you to buy gold in 1970; but had youdone so when it became legal for “free “ Americans to own gold, then your money would have appreciated at an annual rate of 32.65% (this is the real return, adjusted for inflation).</p>

<p>The three best investments in the last decade have been gold, silver, and stamps. The best money investment has been Swiss francs which earned a real adjusted return of 3.7% each year.</p>

<p>Honey Money for 1990
/ assume that anyone with good sense has some silver coin buried in the back 40 against the day everything falls apart and people refuse the politicians’ printed promises they laughingly call “money.” Silver on downswings is still a good buy if you don’t plan to read the financial pages and do plan to keep the silver until at least 1990 or the balloon goes up. I prefer silver to gold because of the ease of investing in it, the ready recognizability of a genuine U.S. silver dime, and the availability of small denominations.</p>

<p>A dime minted from 1916 through 1965contains .07234 of an ounce of pure silver. When silver is $49 an ounce, a real dime is worth $3.54; whereas on the historical silver/gold average ratio of 20:1 a gold Krugerrand will be around $900 — a little big to use to pay for a pound of hamburger.
The silver market has been discovered by the lemmings, and for anything other than survival or planning in decades, silver as an investment is a crap shoot — maybe a bit less honest. However, I don’t think anyone who bought silver at $40 in February, and buried it and stopped reading newspapers and digs it up in February 1990, is going to be unhappy.
Reliable Old Gnomes, Making Honey Better’n Bees</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is in 1980 no analogous madness to the insanity organized by the late sainted JFK when he decided to sell off the largest accumulation of silver in history. I have nothing as safe and wonderful as leveraged U. S. dimes to recommend in 1980.
Therefore, it’s the Swiss gnomes as your honey bees for 1990.</p>

<p>It used to be that a prudent fellow could purchase an annuity through an assurance society and reliably plan his fading years in the safety and glory of the U.S. dollar. These days you might as well use toilet paper for an umbrella. In 1970 had you bought a fixed annuity of 1,000 U.S. dollars each month from a U.S. firm dealing in U.S. dollars, by 1979 you would need 700 extra dollars to keep even; but your assurance society would be paying you only the same little grand.</p>

<p>An annuity bought the same year from a Swiss Assurance Society would be paying more than $2,600 in 1979. Your style of living would have jounced merrily upward, gilded by Swiss good sense and a commodity (gold) backed currency. There never has been a failure of a Swiss Assurance Society; the same ethics and legal protection of legal confidentiality hold as obtain for Swiss banks. There are no nasty penalties as in holding Swiss francs outright; and the downside risk is very small. With a Swiss annuity you are betting on 300 years of stability</p>
