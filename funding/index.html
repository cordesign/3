<h2 id="the-bread-game">The Bread Game</h2>
<p>If you’re raising money from foundations, this blunt little book is indispensable. I’ve been on both sides of the breadline enough to cherish its succinct candor in the bullfart atmosphere of granting. There’s now a whole literature on fundraising, but this book was first (1973), and its forthcomingtthird edition (Fall 1980)js^ likely to still be the best. -SB</p>

<p>Wealthy Individuals. Many wealthy individuals do not have foundations of their own, but often make taxdeductible contributions to projects. There are all sorts of weird ways of finding these people: contribution reports of liberal political candidates, society pages of newspapers, friends and relatives, etc. They can be an excellent source of funds: first, because you don’t have to go through a bureaucracy to contact them; second, because they need the contact from non-wealthy people. Before you approach them, have everything together to make it easy for them to make a tax-deductible contribution to your group. Read carefully the legal and fiscal sponsor material in this book!</p>

<h2 id="do-it-right-the-first-time">Do It Right the First Time</h2>
<p>The importance of good accounting procedures for all organizations cannot be overstated. Too many groups tend to feel that anyone can keep a set of books. Don’t be sucked into this attitude — i t can be your undoing. Keep good records f r om the beginning. Ask the help of a good accountant to at least get the books set up in good order. Even though you may write your own checks, make all your own deposits and do your own posting. Check back with your accountant every three months so that your books can be reviewed and checked over for accuracy. A good set of books will go a long way toward convincing foundations and other contributors that you are a responsible group.</p>

<p>Developing Skills in Proposal Writing is written by Mary Hall, and is available from Continuing Education Publications, Waldo 100, Corvallis, Oregon 97331. This is the best, economically priced, proposal writing manual that we have seen.</p>

<h2 id="on-free-money">On Free Money</h2>
<p>FROM MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE, the realm of foundations and grants is one of the most cynical in the American economy, though it’s improving a little of late. Generally when you approach a foundation they are friendly and half-recep tive. They consider your project promising if a little naive, and they’d like you to write up a proposal on it. You spend a month learning how to write proposals and a month writing this one. They keep it six months. Your idea has died of  dry rot. Then they request that you re-write the proposal to accommodate (whatever) and it might go through next time the board meets. Do this three times, and you have died of dry rot.</p>

<p>Most actual grants I know of were initiated by the donors, not the donees. The most effective way to get grant money is to be Highly Visible. 
I don’t know why foundation and government money is so often toxic to projects. Maybe because the process becomes so easily dishonest. Do me no favors, and I’ll tell you no lies. Or is it the belief that there’s such a thing as a free lunch that is the root lie? —SB</p>

<h2 id="the-foundation-directory">The Foundation Directory</h2>
<p>The reference book of foundations. Gives addresses, finances, officers, purposes and activities. Foundations are listed by state, which is intelligent, since grants are usually given locally. (For non-foundation fundraising see The Grass Roots Fundraising Book, p. 394.) —SB</p>

<h2 id="robin-hood-was-right">Robin Hood Was Right</h2>
<p>An inspiration and advice kit for rich kids. How to not feel bad about being born to wealth, and how to treat the burden as a creative resource for others. I’m a great supporter of private wealth — through no other means can you get really original and really radical giving in the society. This good book shows how. —SB</p>

<p>If you publicly give away money, you hjuo i t f j c i the fact that you’re going to get hustled. People will invite you to “parties” that are really fundraisers; others will make it their business to get to know you on a friendly basis. You’ll receive tons of letters in the mail and occasional knocks on your door asking you to pay the rent of families facing eviction or bail someone out of jail in Peru, sponsor trips to Tahiti or support a struggling young poet. In short, you’ll be asked to f i l l an entire spectrum of heartrending and sometimes whacky needs that have nothing to do with projects you want to fund. You may wonder, “ Am I really this popular?” The answer is no. In response to this pressure, many rich people have simply disconnected the phone, closed the checkbook, and stopped giving money away altogether. There are better ways to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>The ways of giving anonymously are fairly simple:</p>

<p>• Register a fictitious name w i th the IRS, get a Post Office box and a bankaccount in that name, and start writing checks. For your tax accountant’s purposes, the checks are written by you, but the organizations you give to will think they are from Merdley A. Scrump, or whatever name you choose. Or you can arrange for a lawyer to be your agent. He or she will make donations and sign the checks, telling the grantees they are from an anonymous client.</p>

<p>• It is much better, however, to work out a relationship with an existing foundation or consultant. You will be working with people who are accustomed to keeping secrets and who have the mechanisms set up to channel money from an anonymous donor. One advantage of this method is that it provides you with a more effective cover. If your favorite local tenants’ union receives a grant from, say, the Liberty Hill Foundation, the group will think of it as a grant from the Foundation itself, even though they may be t o ld it is a “donor-specified” grant. On the other hand, if the same group suddenly gets a check from Merdley A. Scrump —who is not in the phone book and is not known by anyone — or from a lawyer representing an “anonymous donor,” that’s an open invitation to start trying to find out who the mystery person might be. A visible passion for secrecy mainly attracts publicity, as Howard Hughes and the CIA have discovered.</p>

<p>One important caution: resign yourself to the fact that partial secrecy is impossible. You cannot expect to give money to organization A in your name, tell them “don’t say it was from m e / ‘ and expect your secret to stop there. It ne&gt;^ w i l l.</p>

<h2 id="the-seven-laws-of-money">The Seven Laws of Money</h2>
<p>Ex-banker Michael Phillips — also ex-director of POINT, the foundation that publishes this Catalog and gave away the million bucks that we got from sales of the Last Catalog — tells all. It’s a bit New Age, but it’s wise, smart, and original on a subject that usually fights those qualities. The book has made a lot of people cheeky enough to try stuff, and it’s helped them get away with it. (See his “Four Illusions of Money,” p. 288.) ^_^ —SB</p>

<p>There Are Worlds Without Money</p>

<p>Money, which represents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses. 	—Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

<p>When you open a checking account, open it with the largest amount of money you possibly can. I’m not kidding! Even if the average balance in your account is only going to be $50, t ry to borrow a friend’s $10,000 home payment for one day so you can use it to open your account.  You don’t have to go that far, but anything over a couple of thousand dollars looks good. You can withdraw most of the money a few days after the account is opened. Really! The reason for this is that the bank records your opening t)alance on your signature card (and often in other places, too), believing that it is representative of your financial status. I did a study when I was a banker and found absolutely no correlation between opening balances and the kind of balances that appeared later on in the same account. It’s such a strong tradition to do i t this way (at least a hundred years old) that bankers still judge people by their opening balance. Try it; the branch manager will smile on you forever more.</p>

<p>When you’re asleep and dreaming, that’s a world without money.</p>

<p>An example of foundations gone wild occurred recently. I funded Margo St. James to organize a prostitutes’ collective to protect street prostitutes from the inhuman daily abuse they get from the police, the courts, and hypocrites. I advised her to let a few local foundations know what she was up to so they would be aware of her project if in the future she should need to go to them for funds. I read the letter she sent to them; no request, just a friendly letter saying what she was doing. One liberal foundation. Pacific Change, invited her over to lunch and grilled her cruelly and mercilessly the same way they do groups they regularly screen. They berated her for not being serious, not being a member of a minority and not being poor enough. Fortunately, she told them to go to hell and left. Another foundation simply sent her a letter of rejection, although she hadn’t applied for money. These institutions are examples of how most foundations are so structured that they become numb in the process of dealing with the pain people feel in the donor/grantee relationship.</p>
