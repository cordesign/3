<h2 id="house-form-and-culture">House Form and Culture</h2>
<p>A relatively unknown and thought-provoking book on primitive and vernacular forces, culture and materials that bring (brought) about their designs. Valuable and instructive for that critical factor in house design: approach. —Lloyd Kahn</p>

<p>The pueblo looks like a land form because the close relation of house form and landscape eflects the harmony of man and nature. The whole landscape is sacred, as is the house, and the whole environment influences all of Pueblo life. In fact, Pueblo Indians beg forgiveness every time they fell a tree or kill a jack rabbit. Corn growing is for them a religious act and an essential part of the total spiritual life. It is this attitude which affects the house, its form, siting, and relation to the land, and helps explain why such buildings enhance rather than damage the landscape.</p>

<p>It could be argued that, if we consider hostility of environment and available resources, the problems faced by the Eskimo are not unlike those involved in the design of a space capsule. The difference is less than one would imagine.</p>

<h2 id="american-building">American Building</h2>
<p>Fitch criticizes architects for not dealing with environmental forces. He finds that our highly developed technology and equipment for manipulating the natural environment have led architects to ignore natural forces as a factor in design. Air conditioning has allowed gigantic buildings of glass facing summer sun, etc. This is an important study of what has gone wrong, why, and what can be done about creating a more human architecture, a more harmonious relationship between buildings and their environment. —Lloyd Kahn</p>

<h2 id="the-healthy-house">The Healthy House</h2>
<p>One of my respected friends has called this book “strange.” Yup, and I strongly disagree with some of the not-very-rigorously-proven assertions. But. But it’s that Old Master of Philosophy of Building Ken Kern speaking, and we know from all the good things he’s brought out in the past ^The Owner Built Home, p. 223, for instance) that Ken is worth listening to. I find the proposals refreshingly annoying, exciting, and I happily admit that reading The Healthy House has started me thinking more carefully about a number of aspects of building. Typical of Ken is that he has built a house incorporating his philosophy: it’s underground, compound-curved, bamboo-rein forced stabilized clay. Egad! Living in it helps protect you from a variety of assaults (some of which you may not have heard of) and augments natural forces that tend to promote good health. Definitely worth a look, especially for the very different point of view. • —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="the-poetics-of-space">The Poetics of Space</h2>
<p>There’s been so much written in the last few years about the external construction of shelters. This book is about the house as interior construct, the house of dreams, the “dream house” that we’re always building until the day we die, and the house of reverie which is the house we were born in, our first earthly home where “a lamp is always waiting in the window, and through it the house too is waiting” for each of us to come in, curl up, and dream. The external metaphor Bachelard uses for the house is the nest that the bird constructs with his own body, using his breast for a tool. He (the bird) suggests that a house is built by and for the body, that it takes form from the inside. “This being the case,” writes Bachelard, “if I were asked to name the chief benefit of the house, I should say: the house shelters day-dreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace.” The county ought to write that into its building code. —Lewis MacAdams, Jr.</p>

<p>Housed everywhere but nowhere shut in, this is the motto of the dreamer of dwellings.</p>

<p>To begin with, the corner is a haven that ensures us one of the things we prize most highly — immobility.</p>

<p>If a poet looks through a microscope or a telescope, he always sees the same thing. Distance, too, creates miniatures at all points on the horizon, and the dreamer, faced with these spectacles of distant nature, picks out these miniatures as so many nests of solitude in which he dreams of living.</p>

<h2 id="learning-architecture-by-lloyd-kahn">Learning Architecture by Lloyd Kahn</h2>
<p>Once I did a slide show at a nearby college. A student came up afterwards and asked if I knew of any good architecture schools in the country. I didn’t.</p>

<p>We went across the street for some coffee and as we sat I told him what I’d do if I were him and wanted to learn building design: spend some months reading high-quality books on vernacular building as well as the world’s great architecture. Then set off with sleeping bag, backpack, camera and notebook for a year or two of travel — studying, sketching, recording, listening, learning. Shelter being so basic, people of all lands seem willing to talk about it. They are proud of handwork (where it still exists), eager to show an interested visitor buildings, local ingenuity. Study humble, indigenous buildings as well as some monumental feats, letting circumstance and intuition guide the way. Sooner or later return home, put notes together, develop film, ponder what has been learned. In between travel and study — preferably before — work for a builder; and learn to draw.</p>

<p>To learn building you’ll probably have to search around to find someone to take you on. Start as a laborer if need be; you’ll pick up the skills as you go. Keep working on and off until you know something about building. It’s a skill useful for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Draw as much as possible. Books can be helpful, but nothing is better than a compatible teacher. There might be someone at a college (this could mean a trek from school to school) who would be the right one. Or you might find a job working for an architect: he’d teach you drawing, you’d help him do drafting and get a salary that increased along with your proficiency.</p>

<p>Study, travel, building, drawing — not in any particular order — could make you into a fine architect, although without the credentials. It could also make you a misfit in today’s western world of building and design, but who knows how long it will all last.</p>

<p>I didn’t have all this together as we sat there on our second cup of coffee, but I’ve been thinking about it since. Because with what architecture has become, it’s hard to learn the skills on a human scale, and most colleges are of little help.</p>

<p>I guess what I’ve done is outlined an alternative (that word again) course in architecture. For those who can’t afford a good school or find one, it would be a vital way to learn the art and science of building.</p>
