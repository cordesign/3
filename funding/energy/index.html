<h2 id="explaining-energy">Explaining Energy</h2>
<p>Just that, and very well done, too. I recommend it highly not only to the outsider, but to the insider as well. The various controversies seem to be fairly dealt with despite the publisher being the Berkeley “Rad Lab.” I’ll nominate this paper as the best introduction to the subject I’ve seen so far Lee Schipper is a man to watch; his work is seen more and more often where people are trying to find the facts needed for good decisions. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="energy-earth-and-everyone">Energy Earth and Everyone</h2>
<p>This book is very different from any other energy book we know of, in that it not only explains, but quantifies and prescribes. If energy is your interest, you really should have one of these at hand. The new 1980 edition brings the contents up to date. —J. Baldwin</p>

<p>Nitinol has a seemingly unique property for a solid metal: it bends easily when cooled and springs back to its original shape when warmed. This “shape memory,” or ability to resume an original shape after being deformed, can potentially be harnessed for power. One scheme for such a purpose developed by Ridgeway Banks at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, uses the unique physical characteristics of nitinol in an engine. The engine is a spoked wheel with 20 u-shaped stripes of nitinol hanging from individual spokes. When the wheel is lowered into a round pan divided into semi-circles of hot and cold water, it begins rotating because one set of wires are cold and go limp, while the others — those passing through the hot water — “ f i r e “ with a piston like motion, thereby driving the wheel around. Power output of this first prototype has been measured at .23 watts. This type of engine could make use of numerous sources of waste heat, as in nearly all current power production plants and other natural sources that previously have been unsuitable for tapping.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is no direct fuel consumption with a nitinol engine (though heat is “consumed”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no by-products from the power production — such as air or water emisisions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Current nitinol engines have low power output.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Engines are only at prototype stage; there is as yet no information on size limitations and capabilities.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>7776 Odums’great contribution has been “net energy accounting,”called “energetics.” The idea is, you check how much energy goes into mining oil shale or into making a solar collector and compare that with the energy output. Many such energy “sources” turn out to be energy losers rather than gainers. (By such accounting the most efficient solar collectors by far turn out to be plants.)</p>

<p>Using their elegant notation for energy cycles, you can convince even politicians of the hidden wisdom or unwisdom of various energy paths. Since 1973 we have been given an energy X-ray of our economy by the historic events around oil pricing. This book and Howard Odum’s more technical and earlier Environment, Power, and Society are the kindly doctor showing what the X-ray means and what to do about it.</p>

<p>In the world of energy, this book is about how to think. (The Odums’ ideas about information — “high quality energy” — are not as convincing.) —SB</p>

<p>Solar heating of houses and water uses much fossil fuel indirectly in the installations. Solar heaters have been used for a long time in sunny climates. Figure a and b compares a solar water heater and a fossil-fuel water heater. In this case solar energy is being used to make low-quality heat energy. In sunny climates, using some sunlight along with fossil fuels, energy is saved by solar heaters as compared with electric and gas water heaters. However, solar heaters use much more fossil fuels than solar energy when they are compared on an equal-quality basis (fossil-fuel equivalents). No net energy is yielded.</p>

<p>Capital costs at the start are high in terms of money and energy; savings are obtained later, after the heater has run for several years. One unanswered question is this: Would more energy have been saved if fossil fuels had been put into something else rather than into solar water heaters? As the energy for required materials becomes more costly, technology for solar heating will also become more costly. One concludes that there are ways to conserve energy using solar technology, but solar technology is not a source of energy for running our economy generally.</p>

<p>solar water heater and (b) fossil-fuel (gas) water heater. Numbers are thousands of Calories per year (fossil-fuel equivalents). (Zuchetto and Brown, 1975.) Both systems use fossil fuel indirectly to supply and maintain equipment. The solar heater takes more equipment but uses less fuel directly. The fossil-fuel heater involves less equipment and storage and less depreciation but requires the purchase of fuel.</p>

<p>Amory Lovins is one of the good guys if you t\appen to be anti-nuclear and pro-environment. But to many economists and other conventional wisdom freaks, he is a pie-in-the-sky type given to Utopian, emotional oversimplifications. I find his simplifications to be the result of crap-removal, and his arguments to be essentially reasonable if humanity is to last much longer. His discussion of nuclear matters is particularly enlightening. I’ve noticed that his noisiest foes are the emotionalists these days; Mr. Lovins is the one with the documentation. —J. Baldwin</p>

<p>People do not want electricity or o i l , nor such economic abstractions as “residential services,” but rather comfortable rooms, light, vehicular motion, food, tables, and other real things. Such end-use needs can be classified by the physical nature of the task to be done. I n the United States today, about 58 percent of all energy at the point of end use is required as heat, split roughly 23-35 between temperatures above and below the boiling point of water. (I n Western Europe the low temperature heat alone is often a half of all end-use energy.) Another 38 percent of all U.S. endtise energy provides mechanical motion: 31 percent in vehicles, 3 percent in pipelines, 4 percent in industrial electric motors. The rest, a mere 4 percent of delivered energy, represents a// lighting, electronics, tele-communications, electrometallurgy, electrochemistry, arc welding, electric motors In home appliances and in railways, and similar end uses that now rego/re electricity.</p>

<h2 id="energy-for-survival">Energy for Survival</h2>
<p>Just about the first analysis of Big Industrial Society energy use tobe noticed by the conventional institutions, this comprehensive overviewremains one of the best and most useful. Starting with basic thermodynamic principle, Wilson proceeds to explain what part energy plays in our society, and what the probable result will be if we continue our wastrel ways. He concludes with a look at probable and possible ways of producing and conserving power. This book was an eye-opener when it first appeared and it still is if you are not well versed in these matters. The documentation is formidable. —J. Baldwin</p>

<p>The reason heat pumps are not in wider use today is twofold: First, the reputation of unreliability has haunted the electric heat pump since its premature introduction on the commercial market in the 1950s. Additionally, since the improved heat pumps have become available, virtually no attempts have been made nationally by elect r ic utilities, manufacturers, or retail outlets to inform the public of their superiority — or even of their existence. This blackout of advertising is astounding in the light of the heat pump’s remarkable efficiency and the fact that the Initial cost of central home heat pump installations are rarely more than 10 to 20 percent more expensive than those of conventional central air-conditioning systems. Assuming the higher operating expense of home electric heating equipment, it is quite possible that heat pumps are cheaper in most areas than the combined cost of a central air-conditioning and heating system; and the operating costs of the heat pump will save an average of two thirds of the yearly electric power bill — while using one thirdithe energy of the common electrical resistance heating system.</p>

<h2 id="energy-future">Energy Future</h2>
<p>The prestigious Harvard Business School adds its establishment voice to the call for an energy conserving solar society. A perfectly straightforward cold-blooded economic case is made in support of this view, using the accepted form but not (surprise) the expected conventional wisdom information sources. The arrival of this book has lent a certain credence to the work of other authors such as Amory Lovins whose work has not necessarily been accepted in high places. It’s a good job. It even reads pretty well. It is a big help to those attempting to convince the powers that be. —J. Baldwin</p>

<p>Already by mid-1977 there was a national de facto moratorium on the purchase of nuclear generating equipment in the United States. As a consequence, the 1979 outlook for nuclear power in the United States is much different from what it seemed to be in the wake of the 1973-74 OPEC actions. Actually, since the early 1970s there have been successive downward revisions in projections of future installed capacity in all of the Western o i l - importing countries.</p>

<p>At an energy conference in Los Angeles, the oil people told the heroic story of tapping Alaska’s North Slope; the nuclear people talked about advanced nuclear technology; the coal people discussed synthetic fuels and slurry pipelines. The engineer from Los Angeles’ Department of Water and Power then stood up to explain how it got the residents of Los Angeles to go along with an effort that substantially reduced consumption of electricity: “We advised citizens to do such things as shut their curtains at night.” Here was a conference devoted to the great energy crisis, the moral equivalent of war, and here was a man who was saying that the solution is for people to do such bold things as close their curtains at night.</p>

<p>This is why, when an aide to one of the most powerful senators on energy issues was asked why the distinguished legislator has never given a speech on conservation, the aide replied, “ I t would either be filled with platitudes or so specific that everybody’s nose would fall into his Rice Krispies.”</p>

<h2 id="soft-energy-notes">Soft Energy Notes</h2>
<p>Friends Of The Earth (FOE) has, among its many enterprises, a division called International Project For Soft Energy Paths. Among the names on the masthead is Amory Lovins, as you might expect from the name of this newsletter. Soft Energy Notes started as a Xerox stack of interesting papers but has now graduated to being a real magazine. It’s one of the most informative around, and because of the considerable travels of Mr. Lovins and the network connections of the other editors and contributors, the contents reflect the forefront of current thought, analysis, and even hardware upon occasion. Many’s the time I’ve added luster to my reputation by quoting from this worthy paper. Your subscription helps finance FOE too. —J, Baldwin</p>

<p>One principal work makes conventional wisdom out-of-date. That is the normal looking, cheap, even frumpy house built by Eugene Leger in north-central Massachusetts. Based on a computer-generated, Lo-Cal design, Leger’s house demonstrates that a low cost residence, with no striking design constraints, can operate in Massachusetts’ severe climate with a winter heating bill of less than $10 per month ($38.50 for January through April, or 11.5 GJ over 2.144 Celsius degree days). This performance level sets a high standard for other designers to match in economics, comfort, design flexibility, and environmental side effects.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Leger’s house is that there is nothing solar about it: it has windows on the north, east, and west sides, and no huge expanse on the south side. It does not contain tons of concrete, piles of rock, or walls of water as “thermal mass.” So how does Leger perform his low-energy trick? With a superb building “envelope”: extra-thick insulation combined with painstaking efforts to reduce air leaks. Leger placed a continuous overlapping sheet of polyethylene on the exterior walls and ceiling. To avoid breaking this air and vapor seal with electrical outlets and plumbing, he installed a newly developed surface-mounted electrical system called the “Gould Electrostrip”. This device is an important part of Leger’s energy-tight design, demonstrating how innovations in one sector can spur advances in another.</p>
