<p>MOST OF THE TOOL REVIEWS in Soft Technology and Land Use are by J. Baldwin and Richard Nilsen. Baldwin is a professional project and product developer, a teacher, and a wide-travelling bricoleur. He has worked with most of the pioneer soft technology groups — Farallones, Integrated Living Systems, Zomeworks, and currently the New Alchemists. He’s worked for Mo^ Tents and Buckminster Fuller. He’s taught design at Southern Illinois University, San Francisco State College, and University of California, Davis. He’s been reviewing for Whole Earth since 1968.</p>

<p>Richard Nilsen is a serious farmer (Colorado, summers) and a professional building carpenter (California, winters). He’s reviewed for Whole Earth since 1973. Both are appalled at how hard it is for the layman to get decent tools. Stores can get them easily from wholesalers but won’t carry them. Lots of the best stuff seems to be available from NOWHERE by mail order.</p>

<p>A scandal. And an opportunity for intelligent business. Meanwhile, see “Breaking the Wholesale Barrier” on p. 148. 	- SB</p>

<p>For that one-shot job requiring expensive and/or uncommon tools, renting is often the way to go. A rented tool will let you do a job yourself instead of hiring a contractor or other worker whose only real attribute is ownership of a tool you don’t have. Pouring concrete is a good example: assuming that there will be one person present who knows about concrete, a crew of friends with rented concrete tools can pour that garage floor at a fraction of the cost of a contractor. Engines can be overhauled, buildings spray-painted, pipe laid, floors refinished .. . a good rental store stocks a surprising array of equipment and associated supplies. These are often biased towards local needs; mud country rentals will include all manner of jacks and come-alongs for instance. Areas where there is a lot of gardening will have manure-carrying trailers. You might be surprised what they have.</p>

<p>You should shop around. I have often found that competing rent-its have very different prices and policies. One may have a better selection than another, or maybe their brand of tool is better or in better condition. Always check a tool for condition, not only to save yourself a drive back to get another if the one you rent faUs on the job, but to make sure that the renter won’t try and stick you for your damage deposit. Make sure damage is noted on the sales slip. Certain machines like ditch-diggers and floor-sanders should be inspected with extra care. I personally run them before acceptance if there is any question. To “get a good one,” it is a good idea to shop early in the morning. Some stores will allow you to take the machine the night before with no extra charge. Don’t be afraid to ask. Sometimes one clerk will be more enlightened than another, and it will pay you to butter up such a person for future use. Get their name. Ask them to save you the good cement mixer for next Sunday. Sometimes you can even talk them into adding a tool you need to their stock. A friendly clerk can also give you invaluable information on using the tool. You should be sure that the directions are complete and that you understand them, but the directions for a floor sander rarely include the advice necessary to prevent the fatal WHAP! flup-flup-flup of the sandpaper breaking that costs you a buck each time it happens. (Pound in all the nail heads first, or they catch the paper.) In the case of a sander, the paper costs can far exceed the rental fee, so watch out when figuring the savings of do-it-yourself.</p>

<p>If you’ll be needing the tool often, it will probably pay to buy it. This would be true for car tuning equipment. For the cost of one professional tuneup you can purchase a set of reasonably good tuning instruments and the instruction book. Have a friend supervise the first time you use ‘em and from then on you’re saving money. Even in this example, though, it may pay to rent the equipment first time around. That way you can try out different brand names without actually buying, and you can also sample the idea of whether you really want to be your own mechanic. Renting also allows you to use a tool of better quality than you could otherwise afford. 
If renting is still more costly than you’d like, consider sharing the rental with a neighbor; schedule your jobs together. (But bear in mind that your name on the contract makes you liable for damage if your neighbor blows it.) Renting together can also save money by reducing the time a tool sleeps while nonetheless being charged for. For instance, you sand your kitchen counter and while the first coat of varnish dries, your friends sand their boat deck. By the time you are ready for the second coat, the sander is back to you again. Like that. It is well to overestimate the time jobs take, especially if you are not adept. Your rental store can usually give you a good estimate of time, assuming they are honest. They’ve had many customers like yourself. They are in business to serve you and can’t take the chance of getting a bad reputation. Usually. With a bit of good sense you should be able to do well, save yourself some money, and be just a bit more independent.</p>

<h2 id="milwaukee-power-tools-por-j-baldwin">Milwaukee Power Tools por J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>If you’re a serious user of drills, saws and grinders or any of a fiost of ottter electric hand tools, Milwaukee is a good way to go. Everything they make is heavy duty, and some of their offerings have achieved the enviable ultimate accolade: their names have become THE name for the tool. Hole Hawg and Sawzall are two that come to mind. Many of their tools have a nifty cord that snaps out of the handle so you can put the drill to bed without having to roll the cord around it into the inevitable snake tangle. Much of their line is double-insulated making it safer to use under poor conditions. There are other worthy domestic brands but Milwaukee is my favorite. Expensive and worth every penny.</p>

<h2 id="cutawl-by-j-baldwin">Cutawl by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Virtually every display and exhibit shop has one of these precision woodpeckers and I have used mine for all manner of wonderful and occasionally bizarre purposes. The thing can be guided so accurately that it is actually reasonable to cut lacework out of Masonite or thin metal. They come with a grand assortment of blades: the knife blades can be used to cut cloth patterns, tiny saws will deal with allcuttable metals, chisels cut cardboard (leaving a beveled edge!) for gaskets and display work, lea ther, plexiglas, formica, contour models, etc. It’s sort of like a sabresaw in its uses, but much easier to control. The edge it leaves usually requires no finishing — it’s that good. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="bosch-power-tools-by-j-balwin">Bosch Power Tools by J. Balwin</h2>
<p>The ultimate in heavy duty electric hand tools. Many rental stores rent Bosch for good reason: they last. Some of their tools are the very best available anywhere, the orbital-action jigsaw being a famous example. Costing up to three times more than a domestic industrial saw, it can do things, easily, that no other can. For instance, I once cut an 8 inch round hole in the side of a huge K “ thick steel tank in a location that made a cutting torch too dangerous. It only took about 15 minutes! My Bosch drills have been in hard use for ten years without trouble. Don’t be fooled by horsepower or ampere ratings of Bosch versus other brands. Bosch has a good electrical design that uses less juice but puts out more power — their smallest %” drill will wind your arm off at the root if you aren ‘t careful! All of my own hand electric tools are Bosch. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="portalign-by-august-mohr">Portalign by August Mohr</h2>
<p>Control. Until this tool, the only things I had found to give precise control to using a hand drill were those small drill-press type mounts. There isn’t much that those devices can do that this can’t do just as easily. I leave mine permanently attached to my drill. In nearly a year, I haven’t had any job for my drill that this didn’t make easier and more accurate. —August Mohr</p>

<h2 id="pro-level-by-j-baldwin">Pro Level by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>This dial level has a wide range of uses ranging from setting the true angle of a solar collector to accurately measuring the angle of an existing roof so the addition will match perfectly. It’s useful to half a degree, and has a table of rise-and-run on the back. Some models have a magnet so you can stick the level to a pipe or other metal you are bending to a desired angle. You can get one incorporated into a standard carpenter’s level, and in several sizes. I’ve found that the large size is easiest to read and use. You ‘II have to make a box for yours; they’re easily munched in a toolbox. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="squangle-by-j-baldwin">Squangle by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>There are a lot of giant protractors and angle sawing guides on the market, but the Squangle seems to be the most useful. I’m sure many of you carpenters already know it, but I’ll bet many of you are unfamiliar with the clever device. It makes easy work of cutting roof rafter angles, especially the must-be-accurate “birdsmouth” cuts. When used with the companion Rafterule there’s no faster or more accurate way to make the complex cuts that defeat so many amateur builders. They’re sturdily made with etched numbers that won’t wear off, and plated against rust. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="blue-grass-tools-by-richard-nilsen">Blue Grass Tools by Richard Nilsen</h2>
<p>Blue Grass Tools have been made at one factory in Louisville, Kentucky since 1840. Their quality is hard to beat and their line of hand tools is very complete. In addition to hammers, saws and screwdrivers, they make tool boxes, cement finishing trowels, cotton and hey hooks, leather • nail pouches, grinding wheels, adzes and soldering guns. 
I have used a 16 oz. Blue Grass claw hammer with a hickory handle for 6 years. It’s the best balanced hammer I have ever swung and I have yet to break the handle. The claw is so finely made that even though the hammer is really beat up, I can still pull nails with it that other hammers won’t get.</p>

<p>Correctly shaped and balanced power head gives maximum driving power. 
Crowned face prevents scarring of wood. Chamfered edge minimizes chipping. Claw bite pulls headless pins or 20D nails. Long curve of claws affords greatest leverage. Eyes of hammer are forged with double taper on all four sides so that head when driven have a positive grip on the handle at the center of the eye. The taper of the handle matches the tapper of the eye, ensuring a very tight fit on all surfaces of the eye when the end the handle is wedged.</p>

<p>Straight grain full octagon white hickory handles are put through a special treatment before driving which prevents any shrinkage of the wood in the ye, thus preventing the handles from becoming loose. Spring neck handle absorbs shock. Swell end grip insures perfect hand hold.</p>

<h2 id="fas-set-sawhorses-by-richard-nilsen">Fas Set sawhorses by Richard Nilsen</h2>
<p>These versatile 12 gauge steel sawhorses cost less than the labor and materials you’d need to make your own from wood. Two styles — the Step-Bench, designed for indoor scaffolding, and the Industrial Sawhorse, which has the great feature of self-stabilizing on uneven ground. Just lean on it, and all four legs are on the ground. Both models come apart for compact storage or transport. Fas Set also makes the Easy Buck, a pair of metal jaws that clamp onto the Industrial Sawhorse and turn it into a buck sawhorse for sawing logs. —Richard Nilsen [Suggested by J.D. Smith]</p>

<h2 id="xtenda-leg-by-j-baldwin">Xtenda-Leg by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Tired of antzy tilting ladders? These legs really do the deed! You can even put a ladder sideways on a flight of stairs safely with ‘em, and that ‘s saying a lot. I’ve been using them for a couple of years now, and can truly say “I wouldn’t be without them.” Sure does beat the hell out of balancing on wobbly half bricks . . . —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="gerstner-tool-chests-by-morton-grosser">Gerstner Tool Chests by Morton Grosser</h2>
<p>if you enjoy reading this CaXa\oqyou are probably the kind of person that is seized by an irresistible urge to open all those beautifully fitted little drawers in antique cabinets. You can satisfy the urge in your own home thanks to H. Gerstner &amp; Sons, Inc. ‘ They make superb wood cases that will hold small interesting things of almost any size and shape: machinist’s chests, medical instrument cases,boxes for artists, photographers, dental hygienists, and so on, ad infinitum. The thing that sets Gerstner apart from their competitors is their concern with quality. You can buy a box from them that will stand with perfect aplomb on your Chippendale end table. Their cases are made of polished quartersawed oak, American black walnut, or can be covered with black leather or vinyl. Prices range from $115 to $269 and one look will convince you that their products are a rare bargain in an injection-molded age. Their service is personal and quick; illustrated literature is available. You can get factory seconds at reduced prices (less 20%) too.</p>

<h2 id="tool-chests-by-max-pepke">Tool chests by Max Pepke</h2>
<p>A note on the Gerstner tool chests. In the old days, craftsmen made their own tools and tool chests. When they went for a job, they didn’t turn in a resume, they hauled their tool chests in and the boss looked them over. On the basis of the quality of the work, he was hired or not. Tools and tool chests were very personal things. —Max Pepke New York, New York</p>

<h2 id="snap-on-tools-by-sb">Snap-On Tools by SB</h2>
<p>Outstanding very expensive mechanics tools. Considered the best. If you’re professional they’re worth it. Otherwise no. Check the phone book, call, and they’ll send delivery truck of samples. —SB [Suggested by Morton Grosser]</p>

<h2 id="solidox-welding-torch-by-sb">Solidox Welding Torch by SB</h2>
<p>A medium lightweight welding torch that uses pellets for oxygen. Very portable. The Solidox torch is available in hardware stores, home-improvement centers and do-ityourself stores across the country. The whole kit only costs about $30 from say, Silvo (p. 144). 5000° hot -SB</p>

<h2 id="ampco-safety-tools-by-george-putz">AMPCO Safety Tools by George Putz</h2>
<p>A good tool kit on board a boat is, in effect, a gland full of antibodies the boat uses to fight infection. Theproblem is that a boat tool kit is the second most infection-liable organ aboard (the first is the bloody electrical system). Tool steel rusts horribly. Of the several manufacturers of nonferrous, nonsparking, nonmagnetic (don’t have to worry about setting them near the compass), and corrosionresistant tools, here’s AMPCO. No sparks means no unscheduled explosions. —George Putz</p>

<h2 id="leversnips-by-j-baldwin">LeverSnips by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Taking my prize for the Tool Most Improved Over The Traditional Type, these “tin snips” are so much better than others that it’s hard to believe that the old kind still sells at all. The secret is in a weird twist in the blade that lets you slide the tool along under the metal without contorting the work and marring it with wrinkles (and your hand with the Dreaded Sharp Edges). They come in lefts and rights as do other snips. Ballbearing action takes less pressure too. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="aushalser-by-j-baldwin">Aushalser by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Uh, for those of you that don’t know what an Aushalser is, it’s a device that makes holes in the sides of tubes so you can attach other tubes there without T fittings. It’s too expensive for the average toolbox but if you have to make a bunch of manifold type flat plate collectors it could save your money. The joints are more reliable and cheaper the T fittings. The tool is made with typical German precision. They also make anifty small tubing bender. The tool can also be purchased separately for less – J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="loctite-technology-by-j-baldwin">Loctite Technology by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Mechanics, especially those working on old, frapped-out machinery, will dig Loctite. Anything threaded will stay together and not vibrate loose if you use the stuff. This is God’s gift to the motorcycle fixer. The same company also makes a glop that you can use to make gaskets with right on the part; and for those engaged in putting new bearings in VW transmissions, they make a bearing seating compound that enables you to use wobbly old transmission cases instead of throwing them away. It works. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="aerolite-glue-by-j-baldwin">Aerolite Glue by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Aerolite glues are well regarded, and come formulated for a wide range of uses, including sailplane construction, skis, and boats. -j. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="klein-tools-by-richard-nilsen">Klein Tools by Richard Nilsen</h2>
<p>Klein is famous for their pliers and lineman’s tools, belts and safety harnesses. They make close to 80 different kinds of pliers for all kinds of applications. Pliers definitely fit in that category of hand tool where spending a few dollars more gets you a tool that not only lasts longer and is easier to use but can also do more things than a cheapo model. —Richard Nilsen</p>

<h2 id="pyramid-foundry-sets-by-j-baldwin">Pyramid Foundry Sets by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>/ haven’t actually seen one of these outfits, but they appear to be typical of the breed. This one seems to have a better-than-average blower system. Sets range from 3 lbs. to 53 lbs. and they claim iron, bronze and aluminum can all be easily handled. The ability to make castings adds an interesting capability to any shop or studio. For instance, you can cast duplicates or missing parts of old wind generators . . . —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="vaco-products-company-by-richard-nilsen">Vaco Products Company by Richard Nilsen</h2>
<p>A professional Quality line with national distribution, Vaco specializes in screw and nut drivers, solderless connectors for wiring, and other electrical hand tools. Their tools are designed for the person who is going to be using them all day, every day. I like their magnetic screwdriver with interchangeable bits (No. 70035). Spare bits store inside the hollow handle, and they are magnetized, which means you spend less time on the floor on your hands and knees looking for that tiny screw that got away. A variation on this is the No. 70427 — the same idea, but with four of the new TORX bits. These are the new 6 pointed screws — also called Star fasteners — that hold together parts o f many new cars and appliances. —Richard Nilsen</p>

<h2 id="one-highly-evolved-toolbox-by-j-baldwin">One Highly Evolved Toolbox by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Our portable shop has been evolving for about 20 years now. There’s nothing really very special about it except that a continuing process of removing obsolete or inadequate tools and replacing them with more suitable ones has resulted in a collection that has become a thing-making systern rather than a pile of hardware. It’s a generalist’s shop; we’re not equipped to produce fine cabinetry or precision machine work. We can manipulate all common materials. It’s orderly enough to permit strangers to find things, but it stops short of compulsive anal neatness. It enables things to get done with less hassle and so things GET done with less hassle. We use it as a threedimensional sketchpad.</p>

<p>People keep asking us what tools to get, where to get them, and how to keep them ready to use. Here’s the story:</p>

<p>S TAN D IN SEARS Tool Dept, and it’ll soon be obvious that you don’t need one-of-each even if you have the money. Ask a craftsman what to buy, and you’ll get as many answers as people you ask, for each has his own favorites and specialized needs. They’ll all agree on one thing though: BUY THE BEST YOU CAN. And the more a tool will be used, the better the quality should be. Tools used every day, especially electric tools, should be of commercial or production line grade. You usually can’t find these at hardware stores. Industrial supply houses are where to go. Take a friend who can buy wholesale. These tocols will be expensive, so we’d better justify the cost.</p>

<p>For many, the best reason to go first class is that good tools are a real pleasure to use and handle. This helps make wor k less labor. The heavy duty stuff looks brutal. It wasn’t made to look good in the box, it was made to do the job and has been perfected over many years. The tough ones have their own klndl of beauty that you’l l see better as your viewpoint gets aligned with reality. Such tools, of course, last longer and are repairable when they finally do wear. They can take a lot more abuse, especially the inevitable overload. They can handle the bigger jobs and poor working conditions that would soon trash cheap versions. And after a few years in your hand, they often get to be old friends.
For tools that get used now and then, middle quality wil l do. By that I mean Sears better grades and no lower. Really cheapo tools are of no use at all, can be dangerous, and often break the first time you use them. They are also discouraging to use, which might even cause a beginner to give up. Our onl y regrets have been not buying the best when we could have. Tools that receive great strain, such as gear pullers, should be super top quality only. If you only need one every five years, rent it.</p>

<p>OK so what tools do you need? How do you start the stash? There are a few basic tools that everyone should have available: Hammer, crosscut saw, adjustable wrench, pliers, screwdrivers (get a set), tape measure, hand drill and bits. Beyond these, you’ d best gather tools as you need them. Auto wor k wil l require a rather complete set of wrenches and a whole boxful l of special tools, some of which are for particular vehicles. Carpentry wil l require another whole group: planes, chisels, etc. Electrical and plumbing still more. Our rule of thumb is if we need to borrow a common tool more than once, we buy one.</p>

<p>Fleamarkets are a good place to look for expensive items like vises or anvils. Absolutely the best place to get a whole mess of tools at once is to keep alert for a widow selling off her deceased husband’s retirement shop. Another place to look is auctions, but you’d better know what you’re doing. You should shop around. Recently in the Bay Area, we were quoted prices varying 50% on a tool we wanted! If you want to buy a bunch all at once, (which makes sense these days of inflation — tools are a good savings account), some stores wil l make you a 20% deal. Even Sears can be dealt with , as the sales people wor k on commission. They and other stores also have unadvertised freight-damaged goods hidden away. These can be good deals, as the damage is often merely cosmetic. Yo u can give a salesman your name (and take his card) and have him call you when a certain tool is on sale or arrives damaged.</p>

<p>Whether in a Big Store or private sale, you should critically inspect each tool for condition. These days, many new tools by reputable (?) manufacturers are faulty . Used ones may be worn beyond repair. Anyway, be nitpick y about it; you’l l be living wit h it in you r hand. An d beware of package deals claimed to be a great saving. The “complete mechanics tool set for $450.00 “ often Includes tools yo u don’t need, and may force you t o take inferior items that yo u would be better off picking up individually.</p>

<p>What do you do about that little voice that whispers, “Bu y one, you might need it someday!” Well, it’s possible you’l l be needing them all someday, but Sears is onl y the ti p of the iceberg. Have you ever seen a real hardware catalog? 2000 pages? On the other hand it often does pay t o get a set of tools that greatly increases your capability, such as a welding rig. Another way t o go is for a group to buy a set of tools for workin g on one particular item, such as old Chevy 6 engines, and then everyone in the group that needs a vehicle gets one that uses that engine and hence those tools, and the consequent parts pile. (That’s being done around here. There must be dozens of 56 Chevy pickups and flatbeds withi n 30 miles.) Some groups get know n for specialties: “th e Butterfl y Mountain people fi x tractors.” Those communities and families pool their resources and buy a set of expensive heavy dut y tools maybe for tractor repair. Yo u have to be pretty mellow to make this work , especially if there is a high turnover of people. But this is a growing trend, and we thin k a good one. It leads t o barter and lessens the need for duplicate sets of specialty equipment.</p>

<p>Our shop is known for its versatility. It’s portable — we’ve installed the entire thing in a recycled 20-yearold , 2y2 ton bookmobile nee breadtruck. Some tools like the radial arm saw deploy through hatches in the side of the truc k to be used outdoors. Others fold under the workbenches (which are all the same height t o facilitate handling large projects). Windows are strategically placed to permit long items to be handled in the drillpress and handsaw. Sixty drawers fro m an old post office hold a host of small commonl y used items and 500 babyfood jars are pregnant wit h various sizes of fasteners. An assortment of scrap metal rides in lockers under the chassis along wit h a 400 0 watt slow-running gasoline generator and the welding rig. The curbside body wall unfolds like a camping tent trailer t o raise the floor area t o 12 x 13 feet wit h a folding 6x 7 workbench in the middle augmenting the ones along the walls. It’s been set up in 12 locations in 10 years. It also pulls the 20-foot Airstream Trailer (The Silver Turd) I live in.</p>

<p>The tools were chosen for quality and versatility. With versatility goes a handy ability t o wor k in harmony wit h other tools, enhancing all. For example, wit h the drills and vises we have, we can dril l a hole at any angle in just about anything. The combinations allow us to easily mass-produce parts like dome struts or Inkle-loom frames. This gives a nice potential for making money as well as greatly easing tasks that might be as bad as workin g in Detroit. Versatilit y also means needing fewer tools which means less money out , less space for storage, and less tools to keep track of.</p>

<p>For many people, the biggest problem with tools is keeping them together. That was our problem too for awhile, especially at an alternative high school where there were always a number of young people who didn’t yet see that tools are in a different category than other possessions. Our answer has been to take the time to try and give people a good feeling about tools being extensions of their own hands, and that tools are the means to getting good shelter and other desirable results. A French poet (whose name I regrettably can’t remember) said, “Hammers spend a lot of time sleeping. . .” We like to see the tools at work. We show people how to use the tools and encourage them to in turn show still others how. Having good tools in the hand, together with that tasty feeling that comes from teaching somebody else, gives the tool borrowers a respect for the whole bit.</p>

<p>We also have all the tools marked with a colored stripe. This not only reduces arguments on job sites where lots of people’s tools are at work, but it makes it easy for people of good heart to return strays. We put out the word: “Bring a blue stripe tool to breakfast” and we round ‘em up. We also ask that tools be brought back at sundown unless needed that night. There’s a place to bring them back to. This is essential. A casual pig-pen shop just can’t keep its tools because there “isn’t any there, there.” As an experiment, we abandoned our collapsed old bureau toolbox and bought a (freight damaged) Sears (the best for the money) rolling mechanics tool chest like you see in big auto shops. We segregated the tools by function and labeled the drawers. The result is that tools are easily looked over and selected and just as easily put to bed. To our great surprise, we found that this chest caused a drastic increase in the number of tools being used and a similar increase in action. We even found that we were using our own tools more! The neat storage made it easy to see who was missing, but people brought them back much more reliably than before anyway. The chest can be locked to control unannounced borrowing which is always a disaster. The overall effect has been that under very poor risk conditions, both sociological and physical, we’ve only lost about $50.00 worth of tools in 7 years! And this without having to get too heavy or “high school shoppish” about things. In case you wondered, we did try the toolboard-on-the-wall. It didn’t work, and nobody we know that’s tried it has made it work either, though it is nice to see all those tools hangin’. It has not been necessary to sentence anyone to being tool crib librarian either. We’ll admit that it takes some time to develop tool-consciousness in a crew, but it can be done, and peaceably. The tools spend a lot less time sleeping too.</p>

<p>Making a deliberate effort to raise your own tool consciousness can result in some interesting new possibilities in your life. As with most mysterious-appearing phenomena, a bit of learning soon clears things up and you wonder what had been previously keeping you from doing your own repairs and thing-making. Sometimes all it takes is a different point of view.
I Easily accessible, functionally sorted tools also give you a ready familiarity with the tools you have. This has two effects. First is that as you get to know your tools, you gain the easy fluid motions that go with using them. You’re not afraid of them any more, though respect is increased. This makes you able to work faster with less fatigue just as good form in sports often makes a big difference. It makes you safer too. Safety is also enhanced by having the tools where you can easily inspect them for condition, sharpness and rust. We have found that safety is largely a matter of attitude. The closer tools are to being a working extension of your mind, the safer you’ll be. Self-preservation.</p>

<p>I’ve remarked that tools are extensions of your hands. No mystery there; a hammer is just a hard fist; a screwdriver, a tough fingernail. But hands usually operate according to instructions from head, so it can also be said that tools are an extension of your mind. Looked at this way, the big (expensive) mechanic’s cabinet with all the tools of similar function stored together with high visibility becomes even easier to justify. 1 find it is effective to store the tools by function rather than by name because this is the most useful way to think of the best tool when you are selecting. Hitters, grabbers, slashers, abraders — regardless of what they are called, are there in their places. You take your pick. Often, just looking at them will give you a better idea not only of what tool to use, but how to do the job or how to design the object. That’s a big advantage of the neat toolbox. If the tools are “somewhere out on the back porch or maybe in the back seat of the VW” then your mind is deflected from creative thinking into a hunting mode, and the aggravation can easily cause you to lose your ability to get things done.</p>

<p>The second effect is that you get to “know” all the tools you own without having to consciously think about it. This makes it simple to round up strays, of course, and it’s easier to see where there are annoying gaps in your capabilities (“we don’t have a lightweight mallet”). More importantly, you begin to think in terms of the tools you have. The eventual result is that you and your entire toolbox and shop become a big, complex tool with many possibilities. You begin to sense what you can do together. Buying tools with overall flexibility of purpose in mind keeps you from falling into the trap of building a one-function capability with accompanying tendency to conservatively fossilize your creativity. This tendency is strengthened as the value of the tools rises, which is the main reason society doesn’t get fast response to its changing needs from large corporations who have sunk enormous capital into shops that make that only. Like fat cars. Once in that position, it’s difficult to evolve at all, let alone without damage or drastic change of form.</p>

<p>So you begin to build your tool capability into the way you think about making things. As anyone who makes lots of stuff will tell you, the tools soon become sort of an automatic part of the design process. Beginners worry too much about skill and safety, rather like new drivers worry most about jerking the clutch when learning to drive a stick shift. It doesn’t take long before more serious aspects take over, and the manipulation problems fade out. But tools can’t become part of your design process if you don’t know what is available and what the various tools do. In addition to buying tools that I find useful, I spend some time reading catalogs so as to become familiar with tools that I can’t afford or don’t need at the time. Tool catalogs such as Silvo (p. 144) are rather like my cabinet in appearance so I find it painless to sort of automatically file the information away in the back room somewhere. Tool dictionaries, especially of older tools, are helpful too.</p>

<p>Some of you are saying about now, “Who wants to get into it that far anyway?” Friends, there are advantages. Obviously, making or repairing things yourself can save you money and time. Well, maybe it isn’t so obvious. Exampje: next time your car breaks down, find out how many hours it will likely take to fix it. You don’t have the time, right? OK, how many hours will you have to work at some job so you can pay that mechanic? For many of you, the hours you have to work to pay the mechanic will be more than the job would take if you did it yourself. Moreover, you don’t have to pay yourself, and the job can be done to your standards and at your convenience. If you don’t have the skills or the tools, that’s what we’re talking about! Doing it and experiment and practice, the easier it will all come and the more independent you can be. Freedom rising.</p>

<p>The ultimate is to make your own tools. Tools fitted intimately to you by you. What could be niftier? Blacksmiths are really into that. A good example is found in the books by Alexander Weygers (p. 160). But tools need not be limited to the shop. How about making your own personal canoe paddle? Or your own left-handed kitchen equipment? You can modify existing tools too. For instance, when we needed to make 7-inch diameter pistons for a small production run of giant raft-inflating hand pumps, we reversed the bit in a hole cutter so it made discs instead. The pistons were then easily and accurately cut from heavy plywood with a great saving in time and material compared to turning them on a lathe that we would have had to borrow. Making the big pump’s leather “piston ring” seals proved to be easy after we spent some time talking to craftsmen in a sandal shop. With their advice, we soaked heavy leather discs in Mink Oil and then pressed them into the desired shape with a matched male and female die rammed by our vise. The dies were made on a handsaw modified with a simple homemade attachment that enabled us to cut bevelled round holes with good accuracy. That attachment was also used to make the next batch of pistons, as it proved faster than the disc-maker on the drill press. Tools making tools making tools.</p>

<p>I can hear some of you saying “small production run! Yuk. . .” Unless you are an artist, and maybe even then, you will sooner or later need a bunch of things all alike. Even with only the most basic tools, you can mass-produce things. The precision and complexity of the produced parts is somewhat dependent upon the adaptability and quality of your tool bank, another reason to intelligently gather good stuff. Large scale mass-production tends to enslave both the workers and the customers. The workers are used as if they were machines. The huge capital outlay for the factory means that there must be a huge and relatively steady demand. This in turn means heavy manipulation of public “desires” and almost always involves politics and coercion.</p>

<p>Small scale production, though, can mean a great reduction in drudgery as well as interesting possibilities in barter. By means of jigs and other simple fixtures that you can figure out yourself, you can be freed from having to measure each part. Hold the piece of wood against the jig and hit it with the drill and all the holes will be in exactly the same place in each part. (See Jigs and Fixtures, p. 163)</p>

<p>We’ve mass-produced thousands of dome struts and parts for conventional construction. We’ve also produced simple looms and the aforementioned pumps (which we bartered for a fleet of rafts and got into the Whitewater river running business), solar collector parts, signs (during an antifreeway fight), toys, boxes, electronic parts, concrete forms, fence rails, adobe blocks, tents, shelving, lighting systems, and model parts, to name but a few. The ability to get on a small production run frees you from dependence on larger less efficient manufacturers, their prices, specifications and schedules. It can be rather fun, too, if it doesn’t go on for too long. “Shop Yoga,” we sometimes call it.</p>

<p>And it can be done without sophisticated expensive equipment if you take the time to think it all out first. The thinking is the most powerful part. You can actually change some things out there! Maybe not in a big way, but certainly at a scale that you can understand. You will find that as you work, your understanding of technology will increase a bit, and your fears based on ignorance will decrease. (Your fears based on newfound understanding might well increase, but that’s another paper.) In a modest way, you can combat the “machines taking over” by having better control of the technology you live with. It’s a good feeling.</p>
