<h2 id="freedom-inside-the-organization">Freedom Inside the Organization</h2>
<p>Most people who work for large institutions are aware of the fact that for 40 hours a week they are deprived of many Constitutional Amendment rights. This book examines the issues and begins the long 20 - 40 year battle ahead of us to bring civil liberties to the institutionalized employee. —Michael Phillips
At Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, a worker can get a free lunch by sitting at an executive’s table in the cafeteria and taking part in a rap session where no questions are out of bounds.
•
In England, reports business writer Nancy Foy, the president of a large process company made significant changes in operations after he began sitting down with employees, leveling with them, and listening at length to their most devastating criticisms of management. Despite lack of cooperation from middle managers, the interchange led to significant changes in production and personnel policies, with the company going from a static, break-even level to a very profitable one.
•
In 1974 the Wall Street Journal reported that Combustion Engineering, its management incensed by a Journal article describing certain terms of nuclear power contracts negotiated by the company, was requiring officers and employees to submit to lie detector tests. “Do you know anybody at the Wall Street Journal?” was one question asked by the polygraph operator. “Did you give any information to anybody at the Wall Street Journal?” was another.
•
According to Ralph Nader, a U.S. Senate study in 1974 estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 lie detector tests are administered each year in companies. Nader also reported that two surveys showed that the loyalty of about one worker in every five is checked by eavesdropping or other means.</p>

<h2 id="of-acceptable-risk">Of Acceptable Risk</h2>
<p>How safe is that bag of Barbeque Potato Chips? Who says so? Has anyone checked? Have the studies been scientifically valid? Have the results been suppressed? Has anyone tested for interactions with other foods? Does anyone care? This disquieting book tells what’s being done and what should be done. What will be done is up to us as citizens. I found the lack of emotional cause-hustling refreshing. There should be more research done. This tells why.</p>

<h2 id="the-strip-mine-handbook">The Strip Mine Handbook</h2>
<p>In 1977, after a ten year battle, the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act became law. As a result, the notorious abuses involved with strip mining coal are now controlled by the new Office of Surface Mining (OSM), a branch of the Interior Department.</p>

<p>This Handbook is done so well it could serve as a model of its kind. It takes a technical subject, and an even more complex set of federal regulations, and makes them comprehensible to the average concerned citizen. How to spot, document, and report violations, and the entire grievance procedure, from an OSM inspection to a federal court suit, are superbly summarized. Since all the tough language in the world means nothing if there is no enforcement, citizen participation is going to be crucial to the success of the new law. —Richard Nilsen</p>

<p>Acid water (low pH) is caused by the exposure of pyrite to air during the mining process. Pyrite is often contained in the rock which makes up the overburden. Acid is one of the most damaging pollutants. It kills fish and other aquatic life, eats away metal structures and destroys concrete, and increases the cost of water treatment for power plants and municipal water supply and renders the water unfit for recreational use. Low pH also causes other pollutants (such as iron) to become soluble and these in turn cause more damage. Thousands upon thousands of miles of streams have been degraded by acid mine drainage and runoff.</p>

<h2 id="medical-nemesis">Medical Nemesis</h2>
<p>High tech medicine is making us sick, not well, and the essence of that sickness is passivity. Overblown industrialism shames traditional methods of healing, education, locomotion and social organization. Exporting the monster model plunges traditional cultures into a hopeless abyss of underdevelopment and condemns them to ecological insanity. Human abilities to self heal, indeed to self sustain, have been traded off for or expropriated by Big Brother’s quasi-benevolence. Illich, fatalistic, says that to regain control of our health, we will have to re-learn how to suffer pain; to regain our autonomy we’ll have to forfeit our “envious, greedy, and lazy”dreams. (See more on Illich, p. 40.) —Stephanie Mills</p>

<p>Increasing and irreparable damage accompanies present industrial expansion in all sectors. In medicine these damages appear as iatrogenesis [disease caused by treatment]. latrogenesis is  clinical when pain, sickness and death result from medical care; it is social when health policies reinforce an industrial organization which generates ill health; it is structural when medically sponsored behaviour and delusions restrict the vital autonomy of people by undermining their competence in growing up, caring for each other and aging, or when medical intervention disables personal responses to pain, disability, impairment, anguish and death.

In many a village in Mexico I have seen what happens when social security arrives. For a generation people continue in their traditional beliefs; they know how to deal with death, dying, and grief. The new nurse and the doctor, thinking they know better, teach them about an evil pantheon of clinical deaths, each one of which can be banned, at a price. Instead of modernizing people’s skills for self-care, they preach the ideal of hospital death. By their ministration they urge the peasants to an unending search for the good death of international description, a search that will keep them consumers forever.</p>

<h2 id="council-on-economic-priorities">Council on Economic Priorities</h2>
<p>One of the most effective checks on American corporate mischief is this non-governmental research organization. Their reports have earned such confidence that they are routinely transmitted through the economic pages of the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, etc. What the reports detail is the actual anatomy of corporate activity in terms of pollution, worker’s rights, defense contracts, relations with South Africa, energy, pricing, political activity, etc., etc. Credit is given where it is due and blame likewise. A quiet, pointedly effective service. —SB</p>

<p>The single most dramatic development in this year’s annual meeting season is the submission of a large number of anti-nuclear resolutions by individuals and groups around the country. No other single topic has provoked such a large number of resolutions from such a wide variety of individual filers. Thirty-three nuclear-related resolutions have been filed so far, up from six last year. Undoubtedly the Three Mile Island accident, which came in the heart of last year’s annual meeting season, played a major role in triggering this tremendous upsurge in shareholder actions. The high votes received by last year’s nuclear resolutions (all over 5%, five of the six qualifying for resubmission) almost certainly encouraged more submissions. Moreover, the National Council of Churches, after a three year energy policy study, has for the first time taken a formal stand opposing the use of nuclear power, resulting in the filing of 1 5 anti-nuclear resolutions by church groups for the first time this year.</p>

<h2 id="human-fahrenheit-inhuman-celcius">Human Fahrenheit, Inhuman Celcius</h2>
<p>April first, 1794: the French National Assembly adopts the Celsius temperature scale, giving it an official relationship with the Metric system, though of course providing it with no rational one. The scale as adopted is an upside-down version of Andres Celsius’s 0° boiling point of water and 100° melting point of ice calibration. Is the legislation’s timing an obscure example of Gallic humor?</p>

<p>Copenhagen, 1708: A young instrument maker, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, meets with astronomer Ole R0mer to discuss thermometers. The century prior to their meeting has seen countless experiments with a bewildering and sometimes ludicrous variety of tubes, pots, gauges, ethers, and wines that have failed to produce a.single thermometer that is both accurate and consistently reproducible. Rimer’s experiments have shown the necessity of exact calibration and the use of unvarying points to measure from, and Fahrenheit subsequently devises a method for producing a mercury-filled thermometer tube of constant diameter and two fixed points (originally body temperature and the melting point of ice, the former soon replaced by the boiling point of wateri ), a method which is the basis of all thermometer fabrication today.</p>

<p>His instruments win him wide acclaim and a steady income, allowing further and more extensive research. He is an artisan, not a scientist,^ his shrewd good sense unconstrained by the dogma of his day. He discovers properties of super-cooled water, the effect of barometric pressure on the boiling point of water, and refinements in hygrometer construction. These are significant achievements, but perhaps no more important than the fundamental assumption that the Fahrenheit scale should have an immediately perceivable relation to the human physicality. To do this he had recorded extremes of temperature for Europe and bracketed the 0°to 100° section of his scale with them. This range is appropriate for habitable climates, and stands as an elegant reference point for temperatures outside ordinary human experience, as found in inhospitable times and places (the poles, deserts, sun, space, etc.).</p>

<p>This significant 0 to 100 range, unfortunately misused in the Metric system, is best suited to highdefinition measurements which can be conveniently divided by ten and which “peak” at one hundred. Thus we have a hundred dollars, miles, years, or degrees of temperature indicating significant amounts. Measurements requiring numerous divisors and/or which bear no innate relation to one hundred have other ranges, thus twelve inches, feet, months, eggs, hours, or sixteen ounces or four quarts. In general, arbitrary, person-made sums can be referred to conveniently, some of the time, by tens and hundreds, while interface with the world favors more fractionable systems, the more simply to describe portions or multiples of a given value.</p>

<p>The Fahrenheit scale belongs, of course, in the former category. It is a high-definition system of great humanness, immediately understandable and easily used, since its “metric section” relates specifically to humans, and not just the characteristics of water. Unlike the Celsius scale it is a reflection and extension of ourselves; it does not have the effect of squeezing us into a sterile, high-tech worldview, residents of a minus 15 to 40 degree niche, a fraction of scale having little to do with our daily lives. •</p>

<h2 id="stop-metric-madness-t-shirt">Stop Metric Madness T-shirt</h2>
<p>In bright rainbow colors on 100% cotton, this is the most remark-provoking T-shirt you can wear. Little old ladies come up and warmly agree with you. Strangers open conversation. Even the rare metric proponent is delighted to see this hidden issue addressed in public.</p>

<p>Against 75% citizen opposition or disinterest, some American multi-national corporations, some government bureaucrats, and some educators are trying to sneak metric into general usage. (“Sneak” is the word used by an avid metricizer on the California Metric Conversion Council with me. She isn ‘t kidding. She and one cohort alone managed to get the California Education Department to require exclusive use of metric by California schools from kindergarten to fourth grade. Hearings did not support the move. The press did not report it. It’s a repeat of the New Math disaster.)</p>

<p>Quietly in schools and quietly in government. Many federal bureaucracies now require metric specifications in contracts with private industry. The Department of Defense is moving toward 100% metric (when a costcutter took metric out of the MX missile specs, it saved $25 million). Nothing in the press on this either. Metric conversion has never been voted on in any nation, province, or community in the world. Proponents know</p>

<p>it would Ipse. Except for specialized uses in scientific abstraction and technological micro-measure, metric is an inferior system to customary measure. This T-shirt is a vote.</p>

<p>In a market democracy such as the U.S., metric has no chance to become the standard measuring system. What is possible however is being manipulated part way so that we are left hanging with an eternally confusing and alienating “dual system.” This is what happened in England, which balked half-way in, with dual direction hostility to match. The same is now happening in Canada.</p>

<p>The former scientific proponents of metric have withdrawn their support. Good liberals are now embarrassed by the issue. You can head off the whole thing by complaining at school (British school kids, trained exclusively in metric, have to be re-trained to customary measure when they look for jobs); at any propaganda from the government directed at you through newspapers, radio, bank clocks, etc; and at gas stations, some of whom are trying to sell gas by the liter (worth boycotting on this one is Shell Oil, who is putting the pressure on the
other companies).</p>

<p>Why do schools and governments fall for ideas like metric and nuclear energy that make sense so long as you don’t think about them for more than 30 seconds?-SB</p>

<h2 id="games-mother-never-taught-you">Games Mother Never Taught You</h2>
<p>Learning and applying Harragan’s information is tantamount to “cracking the code” of business success. Most women need to approach big business as though it were foreign territory because until recently it was — only men were allowed into the policy-making ranks. Harragan makesa superb spy, and her book explains the jargon and system of the corporate world. Reading it, you can anticipate moves and plot at the same informed level as yoerr male colleagues who usually have absorbed the basic strategic information as part of their upbringing.</p>

<p>Harragan emphasizes the fact that corporations are modeled after the military and women must understand this model to function in any business. She also dissects the myth of “sleeping yourway to success” and the myth that “goodperformance equals success.” Why didn’t we have this book ten years ago? It would have saved me and my women business colleagues from reinventing the wheel! Read it now, and you’ll have the opportunity to invent a new game or at least succeed at the old one. -Anne Kent f^ush</p>

<p>While you’re at your salary research, if you discover that a man who held your job previously got paid more than you or that a man doing substantially the same work as you (never mind his t i t l e , the job functions are the key) is getting paid more, don’t go home in fury and frustration. Pick up the phone book, look under U.S. Govern- Tnent, Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division. Call up and ask about the simple process to file an Equal Pay Complaint. No one will ever find out because this agency, which enforces the Equal Pay Act, operates in secrecy and confidentiality.</p>

<p>Once you’ve slept with your boss, you’ve ended your upward mobility in that company — and the reason has nothing to do with sex. That particular career path is closed because you violated the chain-of-command relationship. I’ve even seen this happen to men who were close friends when the subordinate man failed to observe the mandated deference and distance required once his friend became his boss.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that long-time affairs between secretaries and their bosses can go on without repercussions, always providing the woman remains in her subservient, noncornplaining role of the dutiful doormat. Those sexual relationships are possible because secretarial jobs have no place in the hierarchy; as presently constituted, they are extraneous servant positions. A secretary has no upward mobility and the job Is not a team position.</p>

<h2 id="privacy--how-to-protect-whats-left-of-it">Privacy — How to Protect What’s Left of It</h2>
<p>A traveller’s guide to the Mystery Land out among the credit bureaus, government computer systems, and new lie detector technologies. This is the definitive reference book on potential privacy invaders and what effects they could have on your life. It will either calm or confirm your fears; more likely both. The tone is a bit Naderishly self-righteous, but that’s preferable to the paranoid cynicism of most of its competitors. Each chapter ends with a list of what you can do to protect yourself — mostly raise hell, gently but relentlessly. —Art Kleiner</p>

<p>If you suspect that your telephone is being monitored, make sure that you can find a motivation for someone to do this to you. Is there family disharmony? Are you involved in political action? Would you be perceived as a threat — using the broadest possible stretch of the imagination — by a government agency or a political opponent? Do you belong to an organization that interests the FBI, the Department of Defe^nse, or local police? Would your employer suspect you of leaking information or cheating?</p>

<p>Next, t ry to prove that information learned by someone else could have come only from telephone conversation on your telephone. One way to do this is to talk deliberately about false (but believable) information on the telephone you suspect is being monitored. Then watch where the informationtsurfaces. If you continue to do this, you may have much more fun than discovering the physical evidence of the surveillance.</p>
