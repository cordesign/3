<h2 id="the-making-of-tools-by-alexander-weygers">The Making of Tools by Alexander Weygers</h2>
<p>Using tools to make tools is as high a craft and calling as they come. Get your forge, anvil, drill-press, and this well-made book. Start with screwdrivers. Work up to shears. With the sequel below, move on to chisels, shovels, and tools of your own invention.     —SB</p>

<p>Most tools are made of high-carbon steel. This is temperable steel. It can be bought cheaply at steel scrapyards and automotive junkyards. And, once you develop an eye for it, great amounts are found strewn along highways and in vacant lots to add to your own scrap pile. No matter how beat-up or rusty a piece of discarded scrap may be, add it to your own supply. Scrap is cheap, and as rusty, corroded surfaces are usually only skin deep, they can easily be ground clean.</p>

<p>Files will often remove steel as efficiently as grindstones — generally as quickly, and with greater control. Don’t neglect learning how to file accurately. Make yourself carry out, at least once, the exercises recommended in dealing with hinged tools like tinsnips, shears, pliers, etc. Try to master the filing technique, for it will benefit all you plan to accomplish in toolmaking.</p>

<p>You will sometimes find yourself tempted to whip out a needed, easy-to-make tool that you have lost or mislaid. I have often made a duplicate wrench, screwdriver, hammer, garden tool, rather than spend the time searching for it. The happy result is that wherever I happen to be working — in the shop, studio, house, or garden — there is always a spare one nearby.</p>

<h2 id="the-modern-blacksmith-by-j-baldwin">The Modern Blacksmith by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>If you ‘ve ever considered learning the Blacksmith trade, you’re no longer safe. If you think that blacksmithing means making horseshoes and little else, you might investigate further. Mr. Weygers’ beautiful book stresses making your own tools and the clever utilization of scrap metal. Starting with a few wise words concerning attitude, he goes on to explain the possibilities that a skill in blacksmithing opens for the craftsman. He continues with explanations of the tools, shop space, materials and basic techniques. He then clearly shows the more advanced tricks of the trade. Every important point is illustrated (by him) with lucid drawings. But the best thing about this book is that it makes you want to go out and Do it. This book is unusually well done, and the author’s spirit of quiet Joy and competence shines through in a way that is rare these days. Now to find a used anvil. . . —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="the-recycling-use--repair-of-tools-by-j-baldwin">The Recycling, Use, &amp; Repair of Tools by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Even if you are an experienced smith, the most recent Weygers book will probably have some things you don’t know; it speaks extensively of recycling old metalworking machines such as lathes and even a trip-hammer. There is a nifty chapter on making bearings, and another on making a good wood lathe from scrap metal. The index shows a diversity stemming from his almost unbelievably varied experience. —J. Baldwin</p>

<p>If the file teeth are not too worn, they can be sharpened somewhat by immersing the files in a bath of acid. The acid seems to bite into the walls of the tooth serration, rather than into its edge, and thus sharpens that edge to some degree. I have successfully used the acid from old car batteries for this purpose.</p>

<p>A Modern Method of “Stropping” Tool Edge</p>

<p>In the shop, a cotton buffing wheel replaces the strop. The rim of the buffer is rubbed with a tripoli abrasive compound and the final burr of the tool edge is cleanly removed by it . It does what the barber’s strop did, but better and a thousand times faster.</p>

<h2 id="hand-made-hand-tools-by-jbaldwin">Hand Made Hand Tools by J.Baldwin</h2>
<p>This nostalgic array of shop tricks and other examples of making-do is a monument to American Ingenuity, and is still mighty useful too. It’s all too easy to forget what one did before there was a local True Value store. The book is valuable for the home made tools it shows, of course, but its main value may well be the attitude it encourages. It should see considerable use around a shop or farm. I’m glad I have a copy. —J. Baldwin
FAUCET HANDLE MAKES SMALL “SOFT HAMMER”</p>

<p>ASMALL hammer made of i)rass, copper, or lead is of great value in assembling or adjusting,’  ‘inc machinery. A hammer of (his sort, small enough to be u.sed fur such delicate work as pun rcpairinR, can he obtained without cost by fiitinfi; a suitable wooden handle lo a brass T-handle laken from an old household water faucel.—'. A. L.</p>

<h2 id="handy-midget-jack-made-from-bolt-and-nut">Handy Midget Jack Made From Bolt and Nut</h2>
<p>FROM an ordinary machine bolt and nut, a scrap of gas pipe, and a steel ball bearing, the amateur mechanic can provide himself with a powerful midget jack that wilt prove valuable for many types of repair jobs. As shown in the drawing, the jack is assembled by slipping the pipe over the end of the bolt and placing the ball bearing in the upper end of the pipe. To adjust the jack, it is necessary only to turn the nut with a wrench. A considerable amount of lifting power is obtained.—F. C.</p>

<h2 id="recycling--repairing-by-j-baldwin">Recycling &amp; Repairing by J. Baldwin</h2>
<p>Similar to Hand IVIade Hand TooBs in character and intent, this book is a mostly •still-usefut coHection of down home ingenuity applied to a large variety of situations likely to be found around the homestead. Many of the tricks of the trade are of the sort us moderns are not used to seeing, but with a tightening economy the sort of thinking demonstrated here has renewed validity. —J. Baldwin</p>

<h2 id="clothespin-starts-siphon">Clothespin Starts Siphon</h2>
<p>Tou can use a clothespin to start siphoning gasoline from a car tank, avoiding the danger of sucking poisonous chemicala into your mouth. Pinch one end of a rubber tube between the Jaws of the pin, and wrap the tube tightly over the whole pin. Place the other end in the liquid and unwind the tube. It will guickly fill with gas.—L. W.</p>

<h2 id="carbon-paper-is-a-id-in-cutting-wail-bsard">Carbon Paper Is A id in Cutting Wail Bsard</h2>
<p>WHEN you are ready to cut the wallboard or plywood panels for a new attic room, a closet, or the like that has switch and receptacle boxes already in place Hi the studs, it’s not always easy to locate just where to cut the boles for these outlets. I found in building a darilroom recently that the large number of electrical fittings made this job extra difficult. So I took pieces of carbon paper and taped them, face out, over the receptacle boxes. Then I set the plywood sheet in place and tapped it with a mallet. The outlines of the holes to be cut were then shown clearly on the back of the panel.—LEONARD C. CROWTON.</p>

<h2 id="hack-saw-fish-scraper-by-harry-g-yocum">HACK SAW FISH SCRAPER By Harry G. Yocum</h2>
<p>A good fish scraper, which will work better than many bought articles, can be made from three hack saw blades and a handle. Holes should be punched in the blades at different distances from the end, as in the illustration, and the blades fastened to the handle with a thumb nut.</p>

<h2 id="country-craft-tools">Country Craft Tools</h2>
<p>How didpre-industrial craftsmen make tapered holes for ladder rungs? How did they make round things? In a Just-the-facts, ma’am manner, Mr. Bland ford shows us the tools and how they were made. Clear drawings show enough so you could do it too. Explanations of how to use the tools are regrettably too brief, but you still get a good idea of how they did it then. —J. Baldwin</p>

<p>An ice axe also had a straight blade. The value of ice for preserving food was known from at least the early nineteenth century, when country estates had ice houses (favoured in America) or pits or caves (more usual in Britain). Winter ice from rivers and lakes was used for as long as it would last into the summer. The tool that was used to t r im blocks of ice was two-handed, with a long thin blade and a pick at the other side.</p>

<p>An ice saw was used with the ice axe for cutting blocks of ice for preserving food in an ice house. This was something like a small pit saw, but with very large spiked teeth.</p>

<h2 id="antique-woodworking-tools">Antique Woodworking Tools</h2>
<p>Restaurant owners and suburbanites of the world, take those antique tools off the wall and use them for real work. Here’s how to purchase, restore, and use. And an tiquers, classic work demands classic tools. Nice book. —Peter Spectre</p>

<p>Before a piece of wood could be shaped it had to be made uniform. The gashes left by the saw while cutting the board from the log were quite deep. It was a waste of time to remove only a t h in shaving with each pass of the plane and obviously something dramatic was called for. The plane which was used for this purpose had been developed well before the birth of Christ. In fact, if Jesus was indeed a carpenter, he was also faced with the need to remove a thick chip from the surface of rough lumber. The tool which was used was called alternately a jack or a fore plane.</p>
