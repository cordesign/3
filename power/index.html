<h2 id="the-craft-of-power">The Craft of Power</h2>
<p>An astounding treatise on the naked wielding of naked power — how to get it, hold it, use it. Appearing more brutal than it is (Siu’s bottom lines reflect on compassion and nobility), the argument proceeds from a torrent of Machiavellian aphorisms to instruction and anecdote. If you have a talent for power, this book may set it resonating. If you have no taste for power, you’ll find that out more quickly here than in the polite corridors of the real thing.</p>

<p>Siu is the author of the Tao of Science ip. 29), a translation of the I Ching, and other works. He has been head of numerous research departments for the U.S. military. This book is the first of a trilogy on leadership. -SB</p>

<p>The seasoned bureaucrat is adept at servo-bureaucrato viscosity: to every challenge there is an equal and frustrating viscosity. He dwells in the nirvana of historical momentum; reversing a bureaucrat is tantamount to reversing history.</p>

<p>Accommodate to the bureaucrat; he will then ease your life and extend your power. But do you otherwise; he will then drive you out of office and out of mind. People are to be used like fuel in the furnace of power, or cleared away like worn-out gears for more efficient replacements.
So that they burn with the requisite intensity, cleanse them of incombustible allegiances.</p>

<h2 id="transcending-the-power-game-the-way-to-executive-serenity">Transcending the Power Game: The Way to Executive Serenity</h2>
<p>This sequel to The Craft of Power is as benign as the other book is fierce. It consoles, congratulates, advises balance and pace, even gives practical guidance about eventual retirement. Where before Siu was talking about his bosses, here, one senses, the old Chinese gentleman is talking about himself. He speaks thus comfortably and with authority from the longest, soundest bureaucratic tradition on Earth. Badly needed ginseng in headlong America.</p>

<p>The annealing of an act into a gracious one requires a certain all-absorbing attention on the recipient, a certain sincerity of forgetfulness of oneself, a certain fitness to the fineness of the moment, and a certain genuineness about it all.</p>

<p>A person travels farther, lasts longer, and acts more equably if he taxes himself at a fraction of his capabilities. Because of the resulting large reserve, he is not apprehensive over possible emergencies. His body is not fatigued and his mind not numbed. He dwells in the midst of difficulties, feeling no despair; brings his goals within ready reach, regretting no rewards passed over. There is no need for sycophancy before superiors, nor abuse before subordinates. His is an easy-going discipline, a genial demeanor, absorbing attention. He induces an airiness of festive calm. His presence is a pleasance. Cruising is prerequisite to t he life of graciousness.</p>

<p>A creature in pain is more pain than creature. To remove the pain is to restore the self. There can be no greater good than that a man or beast be given back his self. Let the reduction of suffering be the foundational expression of your relating to others on earth.</p>

<p>If you plant for a season, plant budgets. If you plant for a decade, plant reorganizations. If you plant for a century, plant people.
Let the cadre prove its selfless commitment and offer up their persons as signed undated blank checks in your strongbox.</p>

<p>Do not place undue weight on that course of action promising maximum gain, if successful. Limit the choices to those preventing a fatal blow to yourself, no matter what the opposition may feasibly do.</p>

<p>Credibility is the greatest obstacle to many an overture to power.
Repeat your thesis often, for people tend to shun the unfamiliar and embrace the familiar. Use phrases mellifluous to the ear, for people like to identify with the pleasant. Make it sound vital, for people incline to align with the important. Announce your intentions to accomplish something, which is actually well on the way. Promise something that seems difficult but is within ready reach of your unseen reserves. Then let the people conclude for themselves that you are truly a man of your word.</p>

<p>Propitiousness There is nothing more important in imparting elegance and style than the art of being propitious. The essence of propitiousness is good timing. More failures in the exercise of power have been due to poor timing than any other single factor. When Catherine the Great ascended the throne she tried to introduce the liberal ideas of Charles de Montesquieu.
But the Russian state of mind was not receptive. Her ministers balked, and the peasant uprising of Emilien Pugachev of 1773 forced her to drop the idea. It took another 120 years before the time was ripe for even a semblance of parliament.</p>

<p>In our own day, there are relatively few executives who possess a really keen sense of timing. Most of them do not know how to use the instrument of time. They are unable to allow precisely for lead time, lag time, incubation time, time to build up a head of steam, time to forget, time to get bored, time to stop talking, and so on. They do not have the feeling for matching the duration of different acts to come into fruition against their respective times of need. They fail to lay the basis for the resolution of conflicts before their actual onset. As a result, they only struggle with the fortitude of facing crisis after crisis. They never glide with the art of de-existing them.</p>

<h2 id="action-from-govt">Action from gov’t</h2>
<p>I’ve found that one of the best ways to get anything out of the national government is by writing directly to your congressperson; the best way to gain results with a state agency (unless you have an unusually good state representative) is through a letter to the governor’s office, although this approach may vary from state to state.</p>

<h2 id="congressional-hit-record">Congressional hit record</h2>
<p>Note to pragmatic existentialists: no matter how whole your particular earth, there’s always somebody in Washington that wants to deal it away. Protect yourself with the Congressional Record. A bit windy but you’ll learn “how to read it with a little practice. And burns slowly with good heat for after use in the fireplace. Write your Congressman and Senators first, to see if they can add you to their comp list. If not: $75 per year, 50 cents per copy, payable in advance. Check or money order payable to Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Well worth the investment. ^</p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>It used to be said that the only safe political behaviour (nevermind one’s pronouncements) was to be economically liberal and socially conservative. Jerry Brown reversed that formula, made it work, and it’s becoming the new conventional wisdom.</p>

<p>This collection of remarks, chosen from the press by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti during the first year or so of Brown’s governorship of California, conveys the freshness of thought he brought to a stale game. The special appeal of the man, besides his intelligence, is his willingness to learn before your very eyes and include you in the process. – . - -SB</p>

<p>I’m going to be very reluctant to approve of spending which does not require basic  undamental structural reforms wherever possible, because just pumping more money into the machine is not going to turn around the very difficult situation that we face in the schools. If you look at the reading scores, look at the achievement scores, talk to kids, talk to teachers, there is something wrong in the classroom. Now much of it reflects a certain malaise in the society, and I don’t really hold the teachers accountable because of the failures of the system. It’s a problem for those in government and those in a position of responsibility to make the changes. I’d like to see some changes. And when people come for the money, that’s the opportunity to make the change. If you just give it away without requiring this kind of change then you lose an opportunity. I don’t want to see that opportunity lost in the event we can make some constructive changes.</p>

<p>There is an elephantiasis that takes over that you get so big you can’t function. I think if you look at the classical world, as the political entity expanded its role and responsibility, it ran into problems both in Greece and Rome that it could not handle. And it was accompanied by these generalized and mystical feelings that as the borders expanded, as the discipline weakened, as the decadence increased, as the classes that were in the leadership position lost their nerve, then those on the perimeter ultimately came through. In 410, when Mr. Alaric walked through, where we had this wonderful civilization, there was grass and wild dogs wandering around. That is not, you know, a lesson that is ignored with impunity.</p>

<p>If they [politicians] would just kind of jump out for a while, and then maybe come back. But they stay long beyond their time. The Greeks had that — ostracism. Ostragon is the potsherd that’s dropped in the pot. If the majority drop it in then you’re out. There was a fellow named Aristides the Just. Aristides the Just was going through his ostracization process, and he stood there and as some Athenian came by to drop in the potsherd which was an indication for him to exile, Aristides said’, “Why are you doing that? Haven’t I been a good man?” And the Athenian said, “Look, we’re tired of hearing the name of Aristides the Just.”</p>

<p>I think there’s a certain amount of truth to that . . . once in power, no one ever likes to give it up. Because it becomes addictive. It becomes co-terminous with your own identity with yourself, and so i t becomes very hard to shake loose from. So all this detached philosophizing, but when the moment of separation comes, I suppose . . . they say they throw you out or carry you out. But I think it’s probably good to make it a relatively brief period.</p>

<p>You don’t have to do things. Maybe by avoiding doing things you accomplish quite a lot. Maybe i f Kennedy had avoided the Bay of Pigs or Vietnam, that would have been quite an accomplishment.</p>
